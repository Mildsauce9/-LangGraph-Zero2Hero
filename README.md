<ol>
  <li> <code>L1.py</code> and <code>L2.py</code> is just practicaing how to make graphs </li>
  <li> <code>Ai_bot.py</code> is a simple interactable agent on your command line interface </li>
  <li> <code> tower_hanoi.py</code> is  an interesting first attempt at an agent. The agent has tools it can use to make function calls. It keeps looking at the current state and makes best moves </li>
